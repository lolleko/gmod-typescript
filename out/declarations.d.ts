 * Similarly to [DIconLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DIconLayout), this lays out panels in two dimensions as tiles.

[DTileLayout](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/DTileLayout) will find the best way to "pack" its children. For example, in a two column layout, a item of height 2 units will be placed in one column while two items of height 1 unit will be placed in the other column. It is worth noting however that because this panel iterates through its children in an undefined order and lays out while it is iterating, there is no guarantee that this packing will lead to the lowest possible height.

 * This is used by the spawnmenu to arrange spawnicons.
 *

 * 
 * In most cases, you should just use Lua's ["pseudo" ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:#Lua), like this:
 * 
 * ```
 * local myCondition = true
 * local consequent = "myCondition is true"
 * local alternative = "myCondition is false"
 * 
 * print(myCondition and consequent or alternative)
 * ```
 * 
 * In the above example, due to [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation), `consequent` would be "skipped" and ignored (not evaluated) by Lua due to `myCondition` being `true`, and only `alternative` would be evaluated. However, when using `Either`, both `consequent` and `alternative` would be evaluated. A practical example of this can be found at the bottom of the page.
 * 
 * # Falsey values
 * 
 * If `consequent` is "falsey" (Lua considers both `false` and `nil` as false), this will not work. For example:
 * 
 * ```
 * local X = true
 * local Y = false
 * local Z = "myCondition is false"
 * 
 * print(X and Y or Z)
 * ```

 * The SQL library allows you to access powerful database software included with Garry's Mod. It is the preferred and fastest method of storing large amounts of data. The database is located in sv.db serverside and cl.db clientside, both in the Garry's Mod base folder. SQL is a whole scripting language in itself although relatively simple, it's something you'll need to read up on before using this library.
 * 
 * Example of using sql.
 * ```
 * -- Creating a table
 * sql.Query("CREATE TABLE my_db_table( id NUMBER , name TEXT )" )
 * 
 * -- Inserting a value to the table
 * sql.Query("INSERT INTO my_db_table( id , name ) VALUES( 1 , 'First') ")
 * 
 * -- Printing the tables data
 * PrintTable( sql.Query("SELECT * FROM my_db_table ") )
 * 
 * -- Deleting the table
 * sql.Query("DROP TABLE my_db_table") 
 * ```
 * 
 * Known GMod [SQL settings](https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html):
 * * Temp files are stored in memory (`SQLITE_TEMP_STORE = 3`)
 * * No `ATTACH` and `DETACH` operations (`SQLITE_OMIT_ATTACH = 1`)
 * * No Virtual Tables (`SQLITE_OMIT_VIRTUALTABLE = 1`)
 * * No `VACUUM` operation (`SQLITE_OMIT_VACUUM = 1`)
 * * No `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` clauses in `DELETE` and `UPDATE` statements (`SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT`)

 * The string *type* is a sequence of characters.

 * The string *library* is a standard Lua library which provides functions for the manipulation of strings.[[1]](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.html)
 * 
 * In Garry's Mod there are several extra useful functions and features added to this library.<br/>
 * Most notably all strings will access this library through the string metatable index function.[[2]](https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/blob/master/garrysmod/lua/includes/extensions/string.lua#L288-L299)
 * 
 * This means all strings are treated like table objects and the string library as its <page text="Meta Table">Meta_Tables</page>
 * 
 * ```lua
 * local x = "Kittens"
 * function string.Foobar(self) return self:Right(4) end
 * 
 * string.Right(x,4) == x:Right(4) == x:Foobar() == ("Kittens"):Right(4) == x[-4]..x[-3]..x[-2]..x[-1]
 * ```
 * 
 * The string *metatable* however is something else, and to access that you must use `getmetatable("")`.
 * 
 * The difference here is related to [Metamethods](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Metamethods), such as using (+) instead of (..) to concatenate strings.
 * 
 * This category lists functions available in the string *library*.
 * 
 * **Warning:**
 * >Using `+` operator for concatenation breaks lua metamethod to sum string as numbers (Example: `"10" + "1"` return `11` (number)) and this is 400 times SLOWER!
 * 
 * **Warning:**
 * >Making changes to the string *metatable* is not a good idea unless you know what you are doing. Use the string *library* instead.
